<h1>MegaChallengeWarPython</h1>
<h2>A program which simulates a game of the chance card game "War".</h2>
I originally wrote <a href="https://github.com/pda87/MegaChallengeWar" target="_blank">Mega Challenge War</a> in C#, as one of the exercices set by the online course I was following on <a href="www.learnvisualstudio.net" target="_blank">learnvisualstudio.net</a>. The original version was in ASP.NET, however, so I had to re-write it as a CGI Python script so I could embed it onto my website.
